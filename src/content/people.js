      description: `Milan Chytrý got PhD in Botany at Masaryk University in 1995. He is interested in vegetation diversity, vegetation survey, methods of vegetation classification, macroecology, alien plant invasions and palaeoecology. He edited the Habitat Catalogue of the Czech Republic (2001, 2010) and the four-volume monograph Vegetation of the Czech Republic (2007–2013). In 2014–2018 he led the project PLADIAS, which synthesized information on flora and vegetation of the Czech Republic in an online database. He studied vegetation in different parts of Europe. In 2003–2015 he led projects of field research of ecosystems in different parts of Siberia, which resulted in characterizing some Siberian ecosystems as modern analogues of the Last Glacial ecosystems of Europe. Currently, he is coordinating the Centre of European Vegetation Syntheses at Masaryk University. He is a Secretary of the IAVS Working Group European Vegetation Survey, Custodian of the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) and Chief Editor of the IAVS journals (Journal of Vegetation Science and Applied Vegetation Science). He teaches Community Ecology and Macroecology, Vegetation and Habitats of the Czech Republic, Vegetation and Habitats of Europe and several field courses and seminars at Masaryk University.`,

She aims to understand the processes behind spatial and temporal patterns in plant communities. She is developing the project "Plant communities through time", in which she explores changes in species composition in permanent plots at different time-scales and relates these dynamics to intrinsic community properties and environmental factors. She also works with the PLADIAS database, where she aims to undercover plant distributions and functional traits in response to natural and human factors on the national scale.

Během doktorského studia začala rozvíjet svůj zájem o vodní a mokřadní vegetaci. Do Brna přišla poprvé během doktorského studia díky programu Erasmus v roce 2010. Na Masarykově univerzitě našla velmi pozitivní prostředí, které ji povzbudilo, aby pokračovala ve svém výzkumu po doktorátě. V roce 2011 získala doktorský titul s prací Klasifikace vodní a mokřadní vegetace ve střední Itálii. V roce 2013 uspěla v projektu SoMoPro (spolufinancovaný programem Marie Curie a Jihomoravským krajem) a od té doby pracuje ve skupině Výzkum vegetace na Ústavu botaniky a zoologie Masarykovy univerzity.

Zajímá se o diverzitu a ekologii rostlinných společenstev. Zkoumá diverzitu rostlin na velké škále ve vztahu ke klimatu a dalším faktorům. Pracoval jak v městských biotopech, tak i v lesích nebo alpínských trávnících. Ve všech těchto systémech analyzoval evoluční vztahy mezi rostlinnými druhy a morfologickými a anatomickými vlastnostmi rostlin k pochopení procesů, které formují ekosystémy. Zkoumal také účinky lidské činnosti na tyto procesy. Má zkušenosti se studiem rostlinných invazí, zejména jejich vlivu na ekosystémové funkce a služby.`,

      description: `Felícia Miranda Fischer získala doktorát z ekologie na Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul v Porto Alegre v Brazílii. Svou kariéru v oboru ekologie začala jako vysokoškolská studentka v roce 2007 a od té doby spolupracovala na několika projektech týkajících se vegetace v původních travních porostů a lesů jižní Brazílie. Zkoumala také vztah mezi pastvou, funkční strukturou rostlinných společenstev a ekosystémovými procesy. Klade si za cíl porozumět procesům ovlivňujícím změny rostlinných společenstev v prostoru a čase. Pracuje na projektu „Rostlinná společenstva v čase“, ve kterém zkoumá změny v druhovém složení trvalých ploch v různých časových měřítcích ve vztahu rostlin a jejich funkční vlastnosti v reakci na přírodní a lidské faktory v národním měřítku. Má zkušenosti s terénními experimenty, výzkumem vegetace trávníků a metodologií studia funkčních vlastností rostlin. Spolu s dalšími mezinárodními skupinami se také podílí na tématech, jako je "dark diversity", úbytek biotopů a ochrana biodiverzity a stability ekosystémů v místním i globálním měřítku.`,

Následovalo bakalářské, magisterské a současné doktorské studium botaniky na Masarykově univerzitě. Záliba v pěstování rostlin ji ale nepřešla: doma obhospodařuje postupně se rozšiřující sbírku sukulentů a spolu s kolegy z Botanického ústavu se pustila do zakládání experimentálních výsadeb lesních rostlin. Její doménou je hlavně les, kde se při sběru dat vyskytuje po celý rok. Píše doktorskou práci o původu prostorových struktur v rostlinných společenstvech a na Oddělení vegetační ekologie Botanického ústavu AV ČR se věnuje hlavně jejich změnám v čase. Zajímá ji spíš detail, drobné měřítko a kratší časové horizonty. Jednou by tam ráda našla klíč k pochopení dlouhodobých změn.`,

V diplomové práci se pak zaměřila na testování rostlin, které by bylo možné pěstovat ve městech z přímého výsevu a také na dnes velmi diskutované téma dešťových záhonů. Nyní pokračuje ve studiích na Ústavu botaniky a zoologie, kde v rámci doktorátu řeší použití poloparazitických rostlin v ochraně přírody, jejich vliv na biodiverzitu a ekosystémové služby. Ve své práci se snaží kombinovat vědomosti a přístupy aplikované zahradnické praxe a základního botanického výzkumu.`,
